# Python Course 2025
This repository contains information about the course _"Basic Programming - Introduction into Python"_ (2025).  

## Acknowledgments
In this class, we will follow largely (but not exclusively) the course [NESC 3505 Neural Data Science](https://neuraldatascience.io/intro.html), developed at Dalhousie University, and which is an open educational resource.

## Course structure
### Approach
This course follows an inverted classroom approach, which means you prepare the material for the sessions at home, leaving the actual sessions for discussions, questions, and problem-solving.

### Materials
The materials consist of
- Online chapters, which will provide you with the respective background
- Jupyter notebooks, in which you can learn and practice Python concepts
- YouTube videos, which go through the notebooks step-by-step. We highly recommand to try to do the notebooks first by yourself, and only use the videos if you encounter major difficulties

__Before every session__, you need to read a few chapters and do the respective Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks are divided into a lesson part, where the concepts are introduced and demonstrated, and an exercise part, where you can apply the knowledge just gained. The latter exercise notebooks need to be submitted to the `Exercise` folder in ILIAS.

__During the sessions__, we will discuss what you learned, where you encountered problems, and how to solve these.

> _Important: The links to chapters point at the original class material, whereas the notebooks you will find in your `bwJupyter` environment - as demonstrated in the first session._
