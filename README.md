# Python Course 2025
This repository contains information about the course _"Basic Programming - Introduction into Python"_ (2025).  

## Acknowledgments
In this class, we will follow largely (but not exclusively) the course [NESC 3505 Neural Data Science](https://neuraldatascience.io/intro.html), developed at Dalhousie University as an open educational resource.

## Course structure
### Approach
This course follows an inverted classroom approach, which means you prepare the material for the sessions at home, leaving the actual sessions for discussions, questions, and problem-solving.

### Schedule

### Materials
The materials consist of
- Online chapters, which will provide you with the respective background
- Jupyter notebooks, in which you can learn and practice Python concepts
- YouTube videos, which go through the notebooks step-by-step. We highly recommand to try to do the notebooks first by yourself, and only use the videos if you encounter major difficulties

__Before every session__, you need to read a few chapters and do the respective Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks are divided into a lesson part, where the concepts are introduced and demonstrated, and an exercise part, where you can apply the knowledge just gained. The latter exercise notebooks need to be submitted to the `Exercise` folder in ILIAS.

__During the sessions__, we will discuss what you learned, where you encountered problems, and how to solve these.

> _Important: The links to chapters point at the original class material, whereas the notebooks you will find in your `bwJupyter` environment - as demonstrated in the first session._

## 25.4. | Introduction, Setup, Project overview
__To prepare before:__
- Read chapters ["About This Course"](https://neuraldatascience.io/1-intro/why.html) (all sections) and ["Introduction to Data Science"](https://neuraldatascience.io/2-nds/introduction.html) (all sections)

__During the class:__
- _Why this course?_ About adult learners and your motivation to learn Python, your programming/Python background, that the only way to learn to code is to write it, the importance of coding skills for science and beyond, and the use of AI tools.
- _The organisation of this course._ Time budget outside the classroom, videos as the last resort, exercises and final project.
- _Setting up `bwJupyter.de`__ and accessing the curse material. How to submit exercises.
- _Getting started_ with the chapters for the following class.

## 02.05. | Variables & Assignment, Data Types & Conversion, Python Built-ins, Lists, Dictionaries
__To prepare before:__
- Read chapter ["Introducing Python"](https://neuraldatascience.io/3-python/introduction.html); you can ignore the section `Deactivate AI for Now`. Also, read the next chapter with the respective learning objectives.
- On bwJupyter: do the exercises in `1-Introducing-Python\1a` and submit the exercises to ILIAS.

## 09.05. | For loops, Conditionals, pandas, Looping over datafiles
__To prepare before:__
- On bwJupyter: do the exercises in `1-Introducing-Python\1b` and submit the exercises to ILIAS.

## 16.05. | Visualisation with Matplotlib, Procedural versus Object-Oriented Plotting in Matplotlib, Subplots
__To prepare before:__
- Read chapter ["Introduction to Data Visualization"](https://neuraldatascience.io/4-viz/introduction.html) and the respective learning objectives.
- On bwJupyter: do the exercises in `2-Visualizing-Data\2a` and submit the exercises to ILIAS.

## 23.05. | DataTypes, Seaborn, Human Factors
__To prepare before:__
- On bwJupyter: do the exercises in `2-Visualizing-Data\2b` and submit the exercises to ILIAS.
